    <p>Hey-o, everyone out there in the SyberWorld.<br/>
      It,s old Creed Bratton coming at
      your again, here from my perch as a Quality Assurance Manager at Dunder
       Mifflin paper. Just a few observations on the world around me.</p>
    <p> What do you guys think is the best kind of car? To me, you can,t beat motorcycles. Why?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>small</li>
      <li>dangerous</li>
      <li>just can't be trusted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sometimes when I,m sick, or feeling blue, I drink vinegar. I like all kinds, in this order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> balsamic</li>
      <li> orange juice</li>
      <li> leaves </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Today in my office where I work as Director of Quality Assurance, we went to the beach
       for some reason that was never adequately explained. When we were there, our manager
        told us to eat hot coals. I thought that was a little bit untoward so I ate a fish.
        Then a woman I have literally never seen before in my entire life started talking very
        loudly about something involving Halpert. She was agitated, I,d say. From what I could guess,
        she was definitely on drugs of some kind, perhaps cocaine, or maybe ‘drines. Also, she is
        a knock-out. She reminds me of a young Daphne Du Maurier. Also, I stupidly ate the fishbones.
         I told myself “never again” after the last time, but then you turn around, and bam, they're
          in my mouth. I also ate 55 hot dogs in 15 minutes, which is a world record. </p>
